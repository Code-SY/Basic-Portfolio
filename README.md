# Basic-Portfolio - Homework 1.

I created a new repository (Basic-Portfolio) on GitHub.
Then I cloned folder onto my machine.
Opened 3  documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
A folder called `assets`.
Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
In the `images` folder, saved the images.
Pushed changes to GitHub.
Wrote HTML files and CSS file added images.
When I finised writing and styling I validated my HTML files and CSS file.
Pushed all my changes to GitHub.
